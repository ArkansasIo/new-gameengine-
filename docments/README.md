## How To Use This Set

- Start with `01-engine-overview.md` for scope and goals.
- Read `02-system-architecture.md` and `03-runtime-pipeline.md` to understand runtime behavior.
- Use `05-class-design.md` and `06-uml-diagrams.md` for implementation planning.
- Use `07-gedd-game-engine-design-document.md` as the master engineering specification.
- Use `08-10` for coding standards, QA, and release planning.
